<p class="drop-cap">Addressing myself this evening
to the task, so dear to every
priest whose veins are warm
with Celtic blood, of paying this annual
tribute of praise to St. Patrick and the
consecrated land of our fathers, I must,
first of all, cast aside the vain hope of being
able to say anything new upon a subject
which for many generations has engaged
the talents of one of the most eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
races of the modern world. Fortunately,
you do not expect or wish to hear anything
new on this subject; the perennial charm
of the theme, like that of the old, familiar
melodies of our fatherland, lies mainly in
the hallowed memories which sway your
souls as you listen. I have, therefore, determined
to follow the well-beaten track;
and I have chosen for my text that passage
of Holy Writ which the wisdom of my
predecessors has oftenest selected as the
most appropriate. Indeed, there exists so
striking a resemblance between the office
and mission of the Irish apostle and his
children in the New Dispensation, and the
office and mission of the illustrious patriarch
and his seed in the old, that this command
given by Almighty God to Abraham,
and these promises made to him and his
descendants, may, without the change of
one iota, be transferred to St. Patrick and
his people. At a time when ignorance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
error were creeping over the earth and
involving all the children of Adam in gross
darkness, the Lord called Abraham forth
from his country and his kindred to make
him the father of a sacred nation, of a nation
which should remain the dwelling-place
of light and truth amidst the universal
gloom, and which, in God’s appointed time,
should communicate its inherited blessings
to all the kindred of the earth.</p>

<p>Now, coming down to the fifth century
of the Christian era, we find in the calling
of St. Patrick an exact counterpart to the
calling of Abraham. True religion appeared
to be once more upon the point of disappearing
from the earth. The Eastern
Churches, torn and debased by endless
heresies, dissensions and schisms, were
rapidly sinking into that miserable abyss
of apostasy from which they have never
since permanently arisen. The condition
of the Western Church was equally critical;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for although, thanks to the transcendent
genius of St. Augustine and the divine zeal
and authority of the Roman Pontiffs, the
pestilential tide of Pelagianism had been
forced back to its native Britain, yet storm-clouds
were gathering in the depths of the
Northern forests and on the Eastern tablelands,
which seemed fated to sweep away
civilization, law, science and religion from
the face of the globe. Already the first tremendous
billows of barbarian invasion had
rolled over Europe and spent their fury
among the sands of Africa. Alaric the
Goth had ravaged Italy and sacked Rome;
Genseric the Vandal sat enthroned in the
ancient city of Carthage. And this was
but the beginning of evils; for innumerable
hordes were still to come, urged on by love
of adventure and lust of conquest, but yet
more by their eagerness to escape the advancing
shadow of the terrible Huns, those
most savage of all barbarians, whose gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
empire, dreaded alike by Goth and Roman,
was stretching itself over hills and
valleys, dense forests and lofty mountain
peaks, morasses, seas, rivers and trackless
deserts, from the wall of China to the banks
of the Rhine.</p>

<p>It was at this emergency that God spoke
to the heart of the great saint whose memory
we are gathered to honor: “Go forth
out of thy country and from thy kindred
and out of thy father’s house, and come
into the land which I shall show thee.”
And where is this land which the Lord has
chosen? Where is the home of those who
are to enjoy light whilst darkness enshrouds
the earth, and liberty whilst all Europe is
trampled under the feet of Goths and Huns
and Vandals? Far away in the West there
stood an island, moderate in extent, wonderful
in fertility, vying with the emerald in
beauty, whose rugged cliffs, beetling over
the unconquered ocean, marked the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
limit of the known world. This happy
island had been for untold centuries inhabited
by a people who, protected by their
watery ramparts from Scythian incursions
and Roman conquests, and unimbued with
the vain subtleties of Grecian philosophy,
maintained a sturdy independence, and
tenaciously adhered to the laws, the institutions
and the religion of their ancestors.</p>

<p>So far as the natural character is concerned,
the Irishman from his very first
appearance on the stage of history has preserved,
almost unaltered, his well-known
characteristic traits. He has ever been
generous in his impulses, quick-witted, impressionable
and hospitable. The spirit
which pervaded the legislation of our
primitive ancestors was rather that of
modern than of ancient civilization. Three
things the Irish people have consistently
detested down from the days of Milesius—despotism,
the so-called “right of primogeniture”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and landlordism—three evils,
whose baneful dominion in the island has
been founded on the ruins of the nation’s
independence. By their ancient law of tanistry,
all dignitaries in the land, from the
chief monarch down to the humblest canfinny,
were chosen by the free suffrages of
their countrymen. “The law of tanistry,”
says an unfriendly English historian (Lingard
II, 86), “regulated the succession of
all dignities from the highest to the lowest.
It carefully excluded the sons from inheriting,
as of right, the authority of their father;
and the tanist, or heir-apparent, was elected
by the suffrages of the sept during the
lifetime of the ruling chieftain. The eldest
of the name and family had, indeed, the
best title to this distinction; but his capacity
and deserts were previously submitted
to examination, and the charge of crime, or
cowardice or deformity might be urged as
an insuperable objection to his appointment.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
So jealous were our forefathers of
their political liberties! Nor did it agree
with their notions of equity that the firstborn
son should enjoy an exclusive or preponderating
right of inheriting his father’s
wealth. Their law of gavelkind prescribed
that a man’s movable property should descend
to all his sons equally, without any
consideration to primogeniture. And what
about the land? Why, a landlord has always
been an odious character in Ireland.
The primitive Irish preferred pasturage to
agriculture, and I believe that preference is
again become quite fashionable among the
landlords over there. A man in the olden
times possessed his land only so long as no
death occurred in his sept. But, to quote
Lingard, “at the death of each possessor
the landed property of the sept was thrown
into one common mass; a new division was
made by the equity or caprice of the canfinny,
and their respective portions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
assigned to the different heads of families
in the order of seniority.” This regulation,
whilst it impresses us favorably as evincing
the national love of fair play, must still be
admitted to have been a crude and primitive
arrangement. But it is amusing to observe
that what modern socialists vaunt as
a novel invention of the nineteenth century
was fairly tried and wisely discarded centuries
ago by the common sense of the Irish
people. Their criminal code bore the impress
of the national gentleness; for it is agreed
that they always shrank from the actual infliction
of capital punishment. Their religion
consisted in the worship of all those great
objects in nature which are most apt to
excite the veneration of a race highly imaginative
and poetical—the sun and moon,
the consuming flame and the running stream,
the mighty tempest, the awful mountain,
and, above all, the mysterious shade of
their oaken groves. And thus they continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for ages unmolested to sing to their
wild harps the praises of their gods and
the renown of their ancient heroes.</p>

<p>This is the nation which the Lord has
chosen for His peculiar inheritance; this
the land upon whose fair horizon the Sun
of Justice is about to rise, never more to
set. Ireland, hitherto thou hast borne no
yoke. Thy hills have never echoed the
shouts of invading legions; no captive
Irish Chieftain has ever graced the triumph
of a Roman General. But that which
Cæsar could not do, Christ will do. Pagan
Rome dared not attack thee; but Christian
Rome has already given the signal for the
assault. Behold, hastening over mountain
and sea, armed with a staff received from
Jesus, strengthened with ample jurisdiction
from the Supreme Pontiff, fearless, undaunted,
Patrick advances, a host in himself.
No novice in the apostolic warfare
is this new champion of Christianity. Inured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to toil, as well by the hardships of
bondage as by long years of extraordinary
penances, instructed in the science of God
by the most distinguished masters of his
age, having served under two great commanders
in a brilliant campaign against
heresy in Britain, he brings to the task
allotted him by Providence ability, skill,
experience and the prestige of past success.
He lands upon the coast of Erin, uplifts the
standard of the Cross and takes possession
of the island in the name of Christ and of
His Vicar. The peaceful glories of his
conquest it is needless to recount, for they
are indelibly engraven upon the hearts of
a grateful race. The Christian world
viewed with astonishment the unprecedented
spectacle of a nation gained to the
faith without bloodshed, without persecution,
almost without resistance. Never did
the arrows of the Divine word fly with
such swift and telling effect as when shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
from the lips of St. Patrick. That Gospel
which had fallen powerless upon the proud
ears of Epicureans and Stoics in the Areopagus,
although preached with all the inspired
energy of St. Paul, fell with a crushing
weight upon the artless idolatry of Tara.
Before the triumphant march of the Irish
apostle idols fall and vanish forever; warlike
chieftains bow their heads to baptism;
princely youths and maidens put on the
monastic garb; the Druids are changed into
priests and bishops, and every harp within
the land is attuned to sing that Patrick’s
God is become the God of Erin. Thus has
the obedience of the new patriarch, the
Christian Abraham, been amply rewarded.
He is in possession of the land which the
Lord had shown him. He is become the
father of a great nation, which, to the end
of time, will enshrine his blessed name in
their heart of hearts with religious enthusiasm.
Generations shall come and go, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the memory of St. Patrick will never fade.
Happy Ireland! which welcomed so great
an apostle; and happy apostle! whose lot
was cast among so affectionate a people.</p>

<p>But now his work is done, and the time
has arrived when the saint is destined to
receive a second call from Almighty God—a
call, this time, not to labor, but to repose,
not to go forth again upon a lifelong pilgrimage,
but to enter into his eternal home.
From his episcopal throne in Armagh the
aged conqueror beholds the entire nation
subject to his spiritual authority, and
through him subject to Rome, and through
Rome subject to Christ. Religion flourishes
throughout the land with the simplicity
of infancy combined with the full
vigor of manhood. How changed is Erin
now from what she was that day when
Patrick in his early youth was cast upon
her shore a despised and downcast slave.
And oh! if we were worthy, my friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to enter into the sanctuary of our venerable
father’s meditations, as he recalls one by
one the events of his long and checkered
career. It is only now, when the drama of
his life is hastening to its close, that he can
fully appreciate the beautiful unity of design
which has reigned throughout it, and
can perceive how all the occurrences of his
life, even the most painful and the most
mysterious, were by the hand of God
woven skillfully into the great mission for
which he had been chosen. But thy trials
are now past, thy day’s work is finished;
“go forth,” faithful servant of the Lord;
thy Master’s arms are extended to embrace
thee.</p>

<p>In this supreme moment, one thought
only, I think, disturbed the fullness of the
saint’s blessedness—the thought that in Ireland
no one had been found in all these
years of his labors who would add to his
apostleship the crown of martyrdom. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he envied St. Peter his cross, St. Paul his
sword, St. Bartholomew his knife, St. John
his caldron! He had been like these
princes of the Church in life, wherefore
shall he be unlike them in death? <em>They</em>
witnessed unto Christ amidst excruciating
torments; is he placidly to expire on his
couch? They died hooted and scoffed at
by an unbelieving populace; he finds himself
surrounded by loving and attentive
children. What means this innovation
upon the fate of Apostles? But courage,
great saint; God looks not upon the gift,
but upon the heart. Though the Irish
are not a people destined to make martyrs,
but rather to become martyrs, yet has not
thy whole life been one prolonged martyrdom?
Thy slavery, sanctified by prayer
and patience, was a martyrdom; thy sacrifice
of country, of kindred and of the comforts
of thy patrician home was a martyrdom;
the ardent zeal which consumed thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
life in the hardships of the apostolate was a
martyrdom; and whatever may be wanting
to thy crown in the shape of torments or
persecutions thou shalt receive vicariously
in the heroic sufferings of thy children in
future ages. Happy fate! Ireland’s apostle
suffers not <em>from</em> his children, but <em>in</em> them
and <em>with</em> them. I love to dwell upon this
sweet scene of St. Patrick’s dying moments.
It is a spectacle of which Ireland alone can
boast. She alone manifested for her apostle
during his lifetime the same filial reverence
which she has paid to his memory since his
death. The nation stood at his bedside to
cheer his declining strength with tender
solicitude. And the saint, whose love for
his children was stronger than death, forgetful
of himself, concentrates his failing
energies upon the one great object of his
affections and his triumphs. Gather about
your aged father, children of Ireland, and
catch the last precious words which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
quivering upon his lips. “Grant me this
favor, O Lord,” he murmurs, “that my
people may remain ever true to the faith I
have taught them.” With this prophetic
prayer on his lips, the blessed man of God
passed away to his heavenly home. He
passed away; but his spirit remained with
his people, and throughout all the vicissitudes
of their extraordinary history they
have remained ever “true to the faith.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the history of Catholic Ireland
seems to be only the sequel or prolongation
of the life of her apostle, and, on the
other hand, the life of St. Patrick might
pass for an excellent allegory of the subsequent
history of his people. That same
admirable unity of design which we observe
running through the life of St. Patrick, that
same Providential shaping of all circumstances
to the working out of a Divinely
appointed mission, is unmistakably discernible
in the history of Ireland. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
destined to be the sacred island, the eternal
home of orthodoxy, the seminary of
apostles; and this peculiar mission demanded
and procured for her the special
fostering care of Divine Providence. But,
before advancing further, it may be useful
to make a few preliminary remarks.</p>

<p>Man is a very complex piece of work,
and may therefore be viewed from a hundred
different standpoints. Hence the histories
that can be written of him are as
multifarious as are the relations in which he
stands to things seen and unseen. Let the
warrior, the statesman, the political economist,
the scientist, the man of letters and
the moralist, sit down to write histories of
the self-same race or nation, and you will
be surprised at the kaleidoscopic variety of
their respective productions. The man of
war will entertain you with a narration of
brilliant exploits on field and wave. Kings
and emperors at the head of mighty armaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are his heroes; sieges and battles,
the impetuous charge and the gallant repulse,
the roar of the cannon and the
gleam of the bayonet—these form the matter
of his drama. The statesman leads you
into the cabinet of princes, to teach you
how treaties are concluded, laws enacted
and the populace ruled. The political
economist revels among bewildering statistics,
shows how the resources of a country
are developed, and expounds the philosophy
of supply and demand. The scientist
follows the student into his quiet chamber,
and traces the steady advancement of
human knowledge. The man of letters
narrates the growth of literature and language.
The moralist studies the vicissitudes
of the eternal struggle between virtue
and vice. Humanity presents a different
aspect to each of these historians; and
very often an age which is pronounced by
one of them most dismal and disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
will be lauded by another as the brightest
in the annals of the race. I have mentioned
several classes of historians; but
these do not exhaust the capabilities of the
subject. There is another relation in which
a man or a nation may be viewed; and it is
the highest and noblest of all our relations—our
relation toward our Almighty Creator.
This is not only our highest relation;
it is, moreover, one which animates all the
other relations. Men were not created to
be food for cannon, as the warrior seems to
suppose; nor to be the dupes of politicians;
nor for any other terrestrial object, high or
low. Man’s destiny is to work out the supreme
designs of Divine Providence. That
historian is, therefore, the wisest who, with
due reverence, endeavors to read human
events in the light of God’s high decrees.</p>

<p>Now, Ireland’s destiny is so patent that
he who runs may read it. Geographically
secluded from the profane world, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
chosen by the Almighty, like Palestine of
old, to be His inalienable inheritance, the
impregnable citadel of Revelation and the
seminary of an Apostolic race. In a world
so tempestuous as this, where decay and
mortality are written upon the face of all
things, where the greatest nations, as well
as individuals, are prone to fall and to become
persecutors of that faith of which
they are the natural protectors, it was necessary
that the Church should have some
nation upon whose fidelity she could securely
rely, and from whose bosom she
could, in times of dire distress, replenish
her spent forces. That chosen nation is
Ireland, my friends. Whilst Rome has
always been, and will always remain, the
head of the Church, Ireland is her right
arm. The Roman Pontiff is the General-in-Chief
of the people of God; but the
Irish are his forlorn hope, ever to be found
in the thickest of the combat, passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
attached to their Chieftain, and yielding a
filial and rational obedience to his venerable
commands. In thus extolling Ireland
I have no wish to rob other nations of their
due meed of praise. Many of them have
deserved well of the faith. Many of
them have powerfully contributed to its
propagation and suffered much for its
preservation. But none of them contests
with our Isle of the Saints the honor
of being in the most complete and tender
manner consecrated to the religion of
Jesus Christ. All other nations have
a profane as well as a sacred history.
They have achieved power and glory
through wars waged in other interests
than those of religion—interests oftentimes
opposed to those of religion. The
history of Ireland since her conversion,
on the contrary, has become thoroughly
identified with that of her religion. Her
national greatness and her national glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
are derived from her faith. If she has
taken to arms, it has been to defend her
faith; for Ireland’s enemies have invariably
begun by overturning her altars.</p>

<p>I am aware that this supernatural way
of presenting Irish history is not palatable
to some individuals of our race who are
tainted with the materialistic infidelity
which infects the present age. <em>Some</em>
there are—not many, indeed, for materialism
and infidelity are snakes that do
not thrive in Irish soil—who hear this
Catholic doctrine with ill will. They
think it likely to breed a fatalistic apathy
in the national breast. They fear it may
dull the edge of patriotism and reconcile
the popular heart to oppression and treason.
Impious folly! Do they imagine
the Irish are like the Turks, that they
cannot distinguish God’s eternal purpose
from man’s petty malice? Believing as
we do that Christ’s sufferings were predestined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are we the less disposed to detest
the cowardice of the unjust judge,
the fury of the infatuated populace or the
base treachery of Judas Iscariot? You
forget, too, my infidel philosopher, that
we are discoursing, not upon Ireland’s
unknown future, but upon her glorious
career in the past. That past cannot be
understood without a constant reference
to God’s adorable counsels. To the eye
of the infidel history presents nothing but
a disjointed succession of contradictory
events, which follow each other without
order, without meaning. It is only when
we survey the life of an individual or of
a nation from the standpoint of Divine
Providence that we are enabled to soar
above “the whips and scorns of time, the
oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,”
and to seize things with the intelligent
eye of the Christian philosopher.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
There are, as I remarked, so many points
of analogy between the life of St. Patrick
and the history of Catholic Ireland that a
poetical mind might fancy the saint ended
his mortal career only to begin life over
again, on a grander scale, in his children.
The life of St. Patrick divides itself into
three distinct periods, the first two of
which are preparatory to the glorious labors
of the third. The first sixteen years
of his life were years of peace and happiness,
unmarred by sin or sorrow. During
this period the young saint, sheltered from
this evil world in the bosom of a religious
home, and surrounded by models of Christian
virtue, expanded in the rich bloom of
unsullied innocence. Then followed the
epoch of his trials in bondage, when the
tender plant was plucked from its native
soil and cast upon the bleak Northern
hills. Here in the stern school of adversity
the delicate became rugged; the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was developed into the man; and the modest
youth began to dream of bold enterprises
and vast spiritual conquests. Thus
St. Patrick was trained to the Apostolate;
and did not Divine Providence pursue the
self-same course with the Irish nation? In
the history of Catholic Ireland we discern
these same distinct periods—the blameless,
childhood, the stormy adolescence and the
apostolic manhood.</p>

<p>1. Whilst darkness and desolation were
covering the rest of the earth—whilst Huns
and Saxons, Goths and Vandals, Moors
and Saracens were carrying despair and
death into all corners of Europe, Asia and
Africa—whilst one by one the bright lights
of ancient Christendom—Jerusalem, Antioch,
Alexandria, Carthage—were being
extinguished—Ireland, exempted by a special
grace of the Almighty from the universal
misery, continued for three centuries
to be the unmolested sanctuary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
faith, the asylum of learning, the nursery
of saints and missionaries. How wistfully
we now look back through all the intervening
horrors upon those happy days of
the nation’s childhood, when, quite unconscious
of the dark future in store for her,
she consecrated her virgin heart to the
service of God; when churches and monasteries
crowned each hill and nestled in
each dale; when the air was ever laden
with melodious psalmody and the perfume
of prayer; when, unable to contain within
her generous Celtic breast the fullness of
her joy, she sent forth, as a presage of her
future apostolic labors, her Columbas to
the Isles of the North, her Columbanuses
into the heart of Europe, and launched her
Brandans upon the western waves to search
out new realms for Christ.</p>

<p>The exceptional character of Ireland’s
position was fully appreciated by the other
nations of Europe. She was looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as sacred ground, and her people were
recognized as enjoying in a very special
manner the friendship of our Saviour. I
narrate a thrice-told tale. To her sheltering
bosom there flocked from all Christendom
studious souls thirsty for knowledge,
repentant souls longing for seclusion, virtuous
souls in quest of refuge and models;
and they found knowledge in her schools,
discipline in her cloisters, and the humblest
peasants in the land could teach them, by
precept and example, the path of Christian
perfection. For the Irish at their conversion
did not put on religion as an outward
garment. The Catholic faith sank deep
into their souls, and became the center of
their private and public life. It absorbed
and assimilated all their thoughts and aspirations.
For their faith they lived and
studied; in it they reposed their individual
happiness and their national glory.</p>

<p>2. But a change was to come over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
face of the island. Indeed, these centuries
of happy tranquillity were intended to be
only a period of preparation, only an introduction
to its history. A Christian nation
can no more than a Christian individual
hope to follow Christ by any other way
than that of the Cross; and as well the
nation as the individual must employ such
periods of peace and quiet in preparation
for the struggle which is certain, sooner or
later, to supervene. That fateful day at
length arrived for Ireland. I can fancy,
my brethren, a scene in heaven like unto
that which ushered in the sorrows of patient
Job. Once more, methinks, “on a
certain day when the sons of God came to
stand before the Lord,” the foul prince of
darkness obtruded his hateful presence
upon that blessed company. Then spoke
our Divine Lord: “Hast thou considered
my chosen people, that there are none like
them in the earth, simple and upright men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and fearing God and avoiding evil?” But
Satan, answering, said: “Doth Erin fear
God in vain? Hast not thou made a fence
for her and her house and all her substance
round about, blessed the works of her
hand, and her possession hath increased
on the earth? But stretch forth thy hand,
and touch all that she hath, and her bone
and her flesh, and then shalt thou see that
she will bless thee to Thy face.” The Almighty,
willing to glorify His elect and
the power of His grace, took up the challenge
so impudently cast before Him, and
gave permission to Satan to wreak his fury
on the devoted nation, making, however,
the same reservation in her favor which He
had made in the case of His servant Job,
that the Evil One must spare its life. A
conflict thereupon ensued which stands
unparalleled in the annals of the human race.
Never were the engines of infernal warfare
brought to bear upon the children of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with such preternatural skill, with such
overwhelming force, with such fiendish
cunning, with such stubborn persistence,
yet never did the infernal serpent sustain
so thorough, so crushing a defeat. Wars
and famines; invasions, conquests, confiscations;
the cruel steel of a ferocious soldiery;
the brutal whip of an implanted
band of robbers; the haughty insolence of
a State-fed heretical clergy, and the canting
hypocrisy of swarms of professional proselytizers;
the ingenious machinery of an
infamous legislation—in fact, what evils
that can afflict a nation were not made use
of in the attempt to eradicate the faith
from the breasts of the Irish? Yet every
new onslaught of the enemy issued in a
fresh triumph for Catholic Ireland. Satan
wrested from her everything but that
which was the sole aim of all his efforts—her
Faith.</p>

<p>No doubt, my friends, the subject of Ireland’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
unutterable woes has often forced itself
upon your minds, and at the remembrance
of her sufferings the tear has sprung
to your eye, and your cheeks have burned
and your breast heaved with just indignation
at the inhuman wretches who, age
after age, have lent themselves to Satan to
be the instruments of his cruelty. But
have you never looked beyond the physical
miseries of each day and hour? Or have
the wails of Erin’s exiles, the dying moans
of her outcast children, as they famish by
the wayside, and the bitter torments of her
legions of martyrs so stunned your soul as
to make you incapable of appreciating the
moral grandeur of the scene? Oh, then,
you have never conceived thoughts worthy
of Ireland! You have seen nothing but
her humiliations; you have not discovered
the Divine glory which shines through
them. You have seen the wretched work
of man, but not the all-shaping, merciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hand of God. My mission, brethren, is
one, not of hatred, but of charity; hence
you must not expect to hear from me
either a pathetic narration of Ireland’s
wrongs or a vehement invective against
her oppressors. Indeed, whilst I am very
far from wishing to extenuate the infamy
of those who have outraged and devastated
the land of our fathers, yet, instead of
fostering rancor against them, I feel more
disposed to bless their infatuated malice,
which, under the supreme control of Providence,
has so chastened and sanctified the
nation as to make it the model of Christendom.
If Ireland, like the other nations,
had “rested on her lees, and had not been
poured from vessel to vessel nor gone into
captivity” (Jer. 48:11), she, too, would
have been a profane nation, with her measure
of worldly greatness and with worldly
ambitions and aspirations; but she would
not have attained that noble station in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Church to which she was predestined, and
for which a long series of trials was the
indispensable preparation. Who does not
sympathize with St. Patrick under the lash
of his captors? But Patrick’s bondage was
necessary for Ireland; and, brethren, Ireland’s
bondage was necessary for the world.
She was led into captivity, not only that
the world might have a brilliant illustration
of the heroism of Christian patience and
resignation, but, especially, that it might
have what it sorely needed, a nation of
Apostles.</p>

<p>3. Yes, my friends, after withstanding for
ages the open violence and the insidious
wiles of Satan, Ireland was advanced to
the highest station in the Church. “God,”
says St. Paul, “has placed in His Church,
first of all, the Apostles;” and by an unparalleled
grace the Irish people were raised
in mass to this sublime office. Other nations
have, indeed, given birth to illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
apostles. Spain may well be proud of St.
Francis Xavier, Britain of St. Boniface and
Italy of St. Augustine. But Ireland has
done still more: she has not sent forth
isolated missionaries; she has gone forth
herself to the extreme ends of the earth.
Oh, how often in these latter days has not
that stern but salutary voice of God resounded
through the island: “Go forth
out of thy country and from thy kindred
and out of thy father’s house;” and even
though that high decree came disguised in
the harsh tones of a bailiff, with what filial
acquiescence in the Divine Will have not
millions of her children bidden a sad farewell
to their native land, their humble
hearth and their dearest kindred, and gone
forth to penetrate the wilds of America, the
jungles of India and the sands of Australia!
Truly, “there are no speeches nor languages
where their voices are not heard;
their sound is gone forth into all the earth.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
With unflagging zeal and superhuman endurance
they have planted the faith under
every star of heaven, making the desert and
the wilderness bloom with all the beauty
of Carmel and Saron. Oh! island of the
saints, how sublime is thy destiny! Everything
pertaining to thee is extraordinary
and supernatural. Thou seemest to belong
to a different world from this, thou art so
unlike the other nations of the earth. Thou
hast been trampled on by every passer-by.
Thy haughty invaders have disdained to
call thee a nation. They have wished to
sweep thee, with thy language and thy institutions
and thy religion, from the face of
the earth. Yet, lo! that which men despised
and rejected, the same has become
the corner-stone of the edifice of God. The
more they trampled on thee, the more
deeply didst thou cast thy roots; the more
they shook thy aged trunk, the more rapidly
didst thou shoot forth thy far-spreading
branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>What is there in nature more beautiful to
behold than a majestic forest tree in the
spring-time, as it decks itself with the luxuriance
of its foliage and blushes in the
pride of its variegated blossoms? How
you wish it could remain ever thus undisturbed!
But that ought not to be; for then
it would live and die in selfish barrenness.
To be of immortal usefulness it must, first,
be shorn of its beauty; the fierce equinoctial
blasts must wrench its seeds from it,
and spread them broadcast over the earth,
and cover them from the wrath of winter
with the leaves torn from its moaning
branches. Thieving birds must carry away
its fruits to scatter them on a distant soil.
If, then, you return to view that noble plant
after wind and storms have worked their
will upon it, you will hardly recognize in
the dreary, naked wood the object of your
admiration a few months ago. But wait a
little. The winter will soon be past, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you will find that the harm has not been
serious, much less irreparable. It will bud
and blossom again in a glorious resurrection;
and behold! far and near a thousand
saplings are springing up, each reproducing
the vigor of the parent stock. In like
manner, whilst nations which have enjoyed
serene prosperity have, so far as the sacred
cause of Revelation is concerned, lived and
died sluggish and inactive, Ireland, rudely
shaken by every wind of heaven, has, without
losing much at home, multiplied herself
in every quarter of the globe. Why,
then, ought we not to bless the whirlwind
which has scattered our noble race? The
tears of the exile were necessary to the
propagation of the faith; and whilst we
sympathize sincerely with the suffering
individuals, we must never lose sight of
the Divine purpose which their sufferings
are predestined to effect.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this analogy between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the life of St. Patrick and the history
of his people, we discover another point of
resemblance well worthy of consideration.
St. Patrick was sent into captivity that he
might become familiar with the language
and customs of the people whom he was
chosen to evangelize. So, too, the Irish,
having been selected by the Lord for the
important work of evangelizing a great
part of the world, were subjected to the
sway of that nation whose wonderful enterprise
has made her language the most generally
spoken by the human species. How
little did the English dream, when they
were planting their proud banner on every
remote corner of the globe, on every island,
on every coast, that Providence was making
use of their ambition for the advantage of
a nation which they despised and of a
religion which they detested? Yet such
the event proves to have been the case.
England’s discoveries and conquests simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
paved the way for the Irish and their holy
religion. England forced the Irish to drop
the language of their fathers, and adopt
that of their oppressors. She was but too
glad to offer them her ships, and induce
them to establish themselves in her colonies.
But, my friends, England has lost, and is
losing, her hold upon her colonial possessions;
whereas the Irish and their blessed
faith remain, and will remain, please God,
till the end of time.</p>

<p>But let us bring this discourse to a conclusion.
I have endeavored to show how
far-reaching and enduring St. Patrick’s
work has been. He is become, in very
deed, the father of a great nation, whose
distinctive trait is its inviolable fidelity to
God. Like their apostle, the Irish people
were great and holy in the days of their prosperity;
their greatness and holiness were
enhanced during the long ages of their trials;
and they have arrived at the summit of spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
glory now that God has scattered them
far and wide to be the salt of the earth and
the light of the world.</p>

<p>Be mindful, therefore, of your mission,
Irishmen and children of Irishmen, and
at the same time appreciate the formidable
responsibility which that mission lays upon
you. No doubt, our great race will achieve
its sublime destiny, notwithstanding the
frailties of individuals; for though there
may be weak and unworthy brethren
amongst us—though there may be Irishmen
who are drunkards, and Irishmen
who are dishonest, and Irishmen who by
other vices dishonor their country and
scandalize the unbeliever—yet the mass of
our people are, in practice and principle,
“true to the faith.” But it is well for us to
remember that it was for no trivial purpose
we or our fathers were transplanted into
this fertile region. Divine Providence has
placed us here, as on a mountain top, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
men may have full scope to observe us, and
may value our faith by the works of righteousness
which it engenders within us.
And, my friends, this great American nation
into which we are incorporated deserves
well of us; for when the old world had
cast us off, it received us with open arms
and welcomed us to an equal share in the
blessings which the Lord of nature lavishes
upon it. But it is our privilege, as well as
our duty, to make a grateful return for this
hospitable reception; for whilst America
possesses in abundance gold and silver,
food and raiment, yet, in a higher sense,
she is sadly destitute. She lacks that better
food which fills the soul, and this food she
must receive from our hands. Faith perfected
almost to vision, supernatural love of
God, unsullied chastity—these are the
spiritual riches with which the half-clad,
half-starved emigrant comes laden to these
shores, and they are an ample remuneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for the many kindnesses which he receives.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us, as is meet and
proper, cease not to offer up fervent prayers
to God, through the intercession of St.
Patrick, for the welfare of the land of our
fathers. She has suffered enough; she
has been tried enough. “How long, O
Lord, how long!” Already through the
many rents made by the stormy indignation
of the civilized world in the wretched
patchwork of this last of Irish Coercion
Acts which is now weighing heavily upon
her, we can catch most certain glimpses of
those happier days, long sighed for, long
deferred; and I am confident that when
the noon-day of her temporal glory shall
arrive, Ireland will remain, as she has hitherto
remained, true to her mission, “true
to the faith.” But of this I am sure, that
if, as we earnestly desire, peace with its
abundance and liberty with her manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
blessings return to nestle among her green
hills, she will ever look back with an honest
pride upon the ages of her sorrows; she
will “rejoice for the days in which she was
humbled, for the days when her eyes saw
evils.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
